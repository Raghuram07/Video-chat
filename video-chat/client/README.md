# React Client Application

This repository contains the client-side application built with React.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:

- **Node.js (v16.x)**: This application requires Node.js version 16. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   After navigating to the project directory, install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Application**

   Start the development server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will execute the following script defined in `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-scripts start"
   }
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000/` by default.

## Building the Application

To create a production-ready build of the application, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate the optimized files in the `build/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Additional Notes

- **Development Server:** The application runs on the development server with hot-reloading enabled, so any changes you make will be automatically reflected in the browser.
- **Environment Variables:** You can configure environment variables by creating a `.env` file in the root directory. Refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that you are using Node.js version 16, as this application is not compatible with other versions.
